This class allows to hold not only vanila genome graph, but also a lot of extra information and also manipulate graphs in multiple ways, including sorting graphs, adding and deleting nodes and links, and manipulating metadata etc.\nAt the moment, there are four ways an instance can be created. It depends on what parameters are passed to the constructor. If parameters for more than 1 option is passed, there is a priority queue which constructor follows. Each option and its priorities are provided below.\n\nPriority 1: If you pass gfaPath as actual path to gfa file, then it will be loaded as is. In this case, the following options are available:\naccessionsToRemove: list or None (default). If not None, a list of strings, if any of the string contains in pathname, the path will be ignored while loading.\nisGFASeq: boolean (default: True). Whether the graph should be considered as sequence graph (True) or as gene/block graph (False).\nPriority 2: If nodes, links and paths are provided (not None), they should be as following:\nnodes: list[str]: a list of strings with node IDs (unique)\nlinks: dict{int:dict{str:list[tuple(int,str)]}}: a dict with keys integers with 1-basednode numbers (in the order as in self.nodes) from which the link starts. Value is a dict with key of directionality of the from node (‚Äò+‚Äô for normal direction or ‚Äò-‚Äô for inverse). Value is a list of tuples with two values: first integer is 1-based node number of node to which the link is going and second string is ‚Äò+‚Äô or ‚Äò-‚Äô representing the directionality in which this node is represented in this link.\n‚Äòpaths‚Äô: list[list[str]]: List, which contains a list for each accession/path, which is represented by a list of strings, each of which has a format ‚Äò{1-based node number}{directionality}‚Äô, where {1-based node number} is an integer 1-based number of node using the order as in nodes, {directionality} is either ‚Äò+‚Äô for normal direction, or ‚Äò-‚Äô for inverted.\nPriority 3: if pathsDict is provided then the graph is created from the paths for multiple accessions. pathsDict is a dict{int:list[str]}; keys are names of accessions, and values are lists of strings of the following format ‚Äò{node name}{directionality}‚Äô, where {node name} is identifiable unique name which identifies the node, {directionality} is either ‚Äò+‚Äô for normal direction, or ‚Äò-‚Äô for inverted. Note, that this can create no-sequence graph only (e.g.¬†gene graph). Sequences can be added later on through adding sequences to GenomeGraph.nodesData list.\nAn extra optional parameter is:\nnodeNameLengths: list[int] or None, a list of alternative node lengths. By default, each node will be represented as a single cell/column, but if provided, variable length can be provided.\nPriority 4: If annotationFiles is not None, but is a list of paths to annotation (gff3) files, then the following extra options are available:\n‚ÄòsequenceFilesDict‚Äô: a dict{str:str}, where keys are IDs of accessions used in annotation files and value is a path to FASTA file (relative to gff files). Assumption is that FASTA sequence names are the same as GFF3 sequence names.\npangenomeFiles: a list[str], a list of GFF3 files for the same intervals as in annotationFiles, ID fields in GFF2 metadata should be the same.\naccOrder: list or None (default), Order of accessions in the graph. If None, accessions will be sorted in alphabetical order.\nchromosome: str or None, if None, create one graph for all chromosomes (not fully implemented, see manual), otherwise, create only one graph for given chromosome.\ndoUS: boolean (default: False) Add unrelated sequence blocks between annotated genes/blocks.\nrefAnnotationFile: str. If given, it has to be a path to gff3 file with reference annotation with reference notation for gene names. In main annotations reference gene names should be identified either in ‚Äúgene‚Äù records under ‚ÄúAT‚Äù key (prioritised), or in ‚ÄúmRNA‚Äù records under ‚ÄúName‚Äù key (fallback). If ATMap is provided, then\nrefSequenceFile: str or None (default). If provided with path, then it will be used to obtain sequences of each block/gene.\ntransmapFile: a tab delimited file with column ‚ÄúOrthogroup‚Äù, which contains similarity ID for genes and a column with name given by transmapFileRefCol which contains reference annotation gene names.\ntransmapFileRefCol: str or None, a name of column for reference gene names in transmapFile\nrefAccession: str or None (default). Accession ID for reference annotation (should be provided if refAnnotationFile if provided).\n\n\n\nImport graph from file\n\nFrom GFA\n\n\nFrom Paths\n\n\nFrom annotations\n\n\n\nImport or create annotation\n\nFrom annotation files\n\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.loadAnnotations\n\n GenomeGraph.loadAnnotations (annotationPath, seqSuffix)\n\nThis function should allow adding interval metadata (annotations) to sequence (nucleotide) graph. It has never been properly tested.\n\nCreate annotation from nodes (artificial annotation)\n\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.updateAnnotationFromNodes\n\n GenomeGraph.updateAnnotationFromNodes (isSeq=True)\n\nThis function is used only for primitive block graphs (e.g.¬†gene and chain graphs) if there is no proper annotation available (e.g.¬†graph was created from paths and some extra information about nodes is needed).\nIt takes ‚Äúname‚Äù of each node either from graph.nodes (if isSeq is False) or from graph.nodesData (if isSeq is True).\nParameters ##########\nisSeq: Whether it contains names as names or as seq.\n\n\nGraph sorting\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.generateTremauxTree\n\n GenomeGraph.generateTremauxTree (byPath=True)\n\nThis function generates Tremaux tree for our graph. It is not a simple Tremaux tree and requires an adjustment process, which happens inside the TremauxTree class constructor.\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.treeSort\n\n GenomeGraph.treeSort (byPath=True, bubblePriorityThreshold=0.5)\n\nThis is the main function for sorting graph. It requires some further work, but works relatively well as is.\n\n\nExport/Save (to GFA)\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.toGFA\n\n GenomeGraph.toGFA (gfaFile, doSeq=True)\n\nRecording existing graph structures to GFA v1 file + some json and joblib files to preserve extra metadata.\n\n\nElements operations (for nodes, links, annotations, etc.)\n\nAdd node, link and accession (not properly implemented or not tested)\nHere another function is needed to add accession with relevant provate nodes and links. Then possibly the functions below will be used but as private function, not external API.\n\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.addAccessionAnnotation\n\n GenomeGraph.addAccessionAnnotation (annotationFile, sequenceFile=None)\n\nIdeally, a function should be able to add one accesstion to existing graph. When implemented, _graphFromAnnotation should be using this function.\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.addLink\n\n GenomeGraph.addLink (fromNode, fromStrand, toNode, toStrand)\n\nNeed testing. Not sure if it actually makes sense as links not present in any of the paths does not play any role.\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.addNode\n\n GenomeGraph.addNode (nodeID, data=None)\n\nNeed testing. Again, there is no point of adding a node to a graph if this node will not be present in any of the paths.\n\nNode Inversion\n\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.invertNodes\n\n GenomeGraph.invertNodes ()\n\nThis function look at inversion/strand of each node in each path. If more than half of paths passing node in ‚Äúinverted‚Äù direction, then inverstion should be switched over (currently inverted passes should become normal and normal passes should become inverted.) It is done every time a graph is loaded. Possibly, it should be possible to not doing it as it will take a lot of time for larger graphs.\n\nNode removal methods\n\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.removeNodes\n\n GenomeGraph.removeNodes (nodeIDsToRemove)\n\nThis (and related to it) function allows removal of a node from a graph. In normal situation, it should not be done to a graph as it will make it invalid in most cases, it is very important functionality for removal of overlaps (see below).\n\nNode Substitution (not implemented)\n\n\nNode overlap removal\n\n\n\n\nGenomeGraph.removeOverlaps\n\n GenomeGraph.removeOverlaps ()\n\nWhen the graph (nucleotide only) is loaded, overlaps are allowed and can be provided using CIGAR strings (it will not be checked). Such overlaps can appear for instance when a compacted de bruijn graph is used (e.g.¬†generated by CUTTLEFISH). They should be removed in order to make the graph not artificially overcomplicated.\nUnfortunately, this current implementation is not working properly and needs to be looked at in details. It is most probably overcomplicated and overthought. It should be relatively easy to do.\n\n\nUtility methods\n\nLink conversion methods\nThere are two different types of data sructure for links: based on sets and dicts. Normally, dict type is used, but for some specific operation sets type is needed. The following two function does the convertion between the two.\n\n\nClass enumerator (nodes) and subscription (links)"

    "text": "Transfer from nodes to components (links and other structures)\nThis is one of the first processes happening while exporting graph. While graph operates with nodes (which can be linearly connected with each other in all paths), then exporting works with components. In almost all cases, components have at least some non-linear links with other components on both sides. The only exclusion is when a component is too large and split into several ones. In this case two components will be connected by 100% linear links. Also, graph operates with paths along with nodes, whereas exporting works with components and accession-specific links between them.\nThese functions (with main orchestrating one is nodeToComponentLinks) are converting nodes and paths to components and links.\n\n\nsplitforwardInversedNodeComp\n\n splitforwardInversedNodeComp (pathList, component, isInverse)\n\n\n\n\nfillLinksBase\n\n fillLinksBase (nodeInComp, nodeToComponent, fromLinks, toLinks,\n                fromComponentLinks, toComponentLinks, compNum, components,\n                doLeft=True, doRight=True)\n\n\n\n\nconvertLink\n\n convertLink (linkFrom, linkTo, translateDict, forwardLinks, isZoom)\n\n\n\n\nrecordUpdatedPairedLink\n\n recordUpdatedPairedLink (firstLinkSet, secondLinkSet, firstLink,\n                          secondLink, substituteLink, pairedLinksConv)\n\n\n\n\nconvertRemovableComponents\n\n convertRemovableComponents (translateDict, linkLengths, pairedLinks,\n                             interconnectedLinks, blockEdges,\n                             forwardLinks, isZoom=True)\n\ntranslateDict should be a dict in format {<old node/component id 0-based>:<new component id 1-based>} pathNodeInv should be a dict of dicts of the following structure: {:{<nodeId 1-based>:}}\nThis is done through fromLinks and toLinks and throught associated directions of available accessions. For this we need to loop through strands and do it separately for each strand.\nFor paired links there is a possibility that a single node link will give several component links. In this case, the cross product of all first and second links will be added to converted paired links.\n‚ùóThe substitute links should be added only to the paths that contained both first and second links in the first place. This should be controlled in link removal routine.\n\n\n\nnodeToComponentLinks\n\n nodeToComponentLinks (components, componentToNode, nodeToComponent,\n                       fromLinks, toLinks, graph, fromComponentLinks,\n                       toComponentLinks, linkLengths=None,\n                       pairedLinks=None, interconnectedLinks=None,\n                       blockEdges=None, debug=False)"

    "text": "Identifying collapsible links and rearrangement blocks (works incorrectly, left now for compatibility).\nIn order to be able to generate multiple zoom levels of the graph view, non-linear links describing small (too small to show at the given zoom level) rearrangements should disappear whereas links describing larger blocks should persist. This will allow to see larger rearrangements clearly on higher zoom levels.\nIn order to do it, each link should be associated with some size (or rearrangement), so, that when each zoom level is generated, they can be removed when the rearrangement cannot be shown at the given zoom level.\nSome links are also associated with each other, and when they are removed new links (usually linear ones) should be reinstated to make larger rearrangements clearer.\nAt the moment, the process of identifying these sizes is not working great as it leaves too much non-linear links to the very top level where suddenly all non-linear links disappear and the whole graph from over-complicated jumps to pretty much trivial without any rearrangements. If to use digital map analogy, most of country roads persist while you zoom out on the map until almost the whole Earth is in view and then at some point the view becomes just a blue/green ball with very rough boundary of continents and oceans.\nAt the moment, all associated links get into a pool of so called interconnected links and if one link gets associated with specific size, then all links get the same association, and then maximum size is selected. But that means that if one link describes one small and also on the edge of large rearrangement, and another link is only associated with large rearrangement, then the latter link will also be associated with the size of large rearrangement and will stay until the zoom level where the large rearrangement is too small to show. That is incorrect.\nI think, each link should get its own associations with sizes (and maximum should be taken) and clearing of the link should happen individually. Yet, if one link with smaller size and one with larger size are paired, the reinstated link should appear after smaller link removed.\nAnother alternative is just to get contiguous blocks in each path and associate each link pair (describing start and end of each block) as a pair of links that needs to be cleared in association with the size of this block. Need control of repeats in these blocks. If it happens, then a single link can describe a whole rearrangement. In addition, an extra control for inversion is also needed. In particular, if outside the block the numbers do not create a range to fin the inverted node (e.g.¬†1+,4-,3+, or 3+,2-,5+), then it should be ignorred for this step. It means there is a smaller rearrangement within larger one.\nAnother alternative (described in TODO) is to convert paths of nodes to paths of edges and operate with them. I guess, it is not far away from the previous paragraph.\n\nIdentifying path breaks\n\n\n\nfindBreaksInPath\n\n findBreaksInPath (combinedArray, nextNodeDict)\n\n\n\n\nidentifyPathBreaks\n\n identifyPathBreaks (combinedNodeDirArray, pathLengths, pathNextNode)\n\n\n\nBlock processing\n\n\n\ninterweaveArrays\n\n interweaveArrays (a, b)\n\n\n\n\nextractGapsBlocks\n\n extractGapsBlocks (block, path, nodeLengths, getComplex=False)\n\nThis function either split block by gaps (e.g.¬†block [1,2,4,5,6,8] will yield [1,2],[4,5,6],[8])\nIf getComplex is set to True, then first gaps are filtered for nodes that are not passed by the path. After that, edges are identified and then for them nodes not passed by the path are filtered out. Then we find the longest block out of edges, and then the longest edge combine with all gaps and find the shortest one. That shortest one is going to be the one returned.\nE.g. block [1,2,4,5,8] will give edges [1,2],[4,5],[8] and gaps [3],[6,7].\nIf path does not contain 6, then edges will be the same, but gaps will be [3],[6]\nIf path does not contain 3, then edges will be [1,2,4,5],[8] and gaps [6,7]\nThe exact block which will be returned depends on sizes of each node.\n\n\n\ncheckSplitBlock\n\n checkSplitBlock (block, gapList=None)\n\nNot used at the moment\nFunction checks if the block has any gaps and split into a list of blocks between gaps (alternatively fill gaps or leave things as they are).

Instead, a very simple (optional) API works alongside main Pantograph Visualisation tool which provides a lot of various metadata on request if API available or do nothing if not. This API uses Redis DB with special DB schema.\nWhen graphs are exported some metadata (annotations, genome and pangenome positions) can be recorded to Redis DB. If Redis DB is not available or recording of metadata is not needed, then parameter redisHost should be omitted.
